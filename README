Befunge Interpreter. 

by Matthew Bender

This interpreter is intended to be compliant with Befunge-93 (with possibility to extend to Befunge-98 later).

To use:
	Download all the .c and .h files here, as well as the Makefile. Then just run 'make' and the executable bfg is created. bfg takes 1 argument, the name of the Befunge file to interpret. 

Some notes on liberties I have taken:
	-In the Befunge file, code outside of the playfield is ignored.
	-Popping and peeking from an empty stack returns 0.
	-The stack consists of signed integers.
	-Using the 'g' command outside the bounds of the playfield will push 0 onto the stack
	-Using the 'p' command outside the bounds of the playfield will do nothing
	-Printing does not print a space as well, like some interpreters I've found
